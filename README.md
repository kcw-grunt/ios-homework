# Eaze iOS Homework

>Our iOS code challenge for engineering applicants

## Project

Using the [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI), implement a gif search app. This is an open ended project so do as much or as little as you think is necessary to achieve the desired goal.

## Structure

Do not use interface builder to make this app. If you want to complete this project using React Native then that is also an option. This app should work with iOS 9+.
