# Eaze iOS Homework - Kerry Washington

>Our iOS code challenge for engineering applicants

## Project

Using the [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI), implement a gif search app. This is an open ended project so do as much or as little as you think is necessary to achieve the desired goal.

## Structure

Do not use interface builder to make this app. Use Swift or Objective C, third party framerworks (masonry etc) are also allowed. Alternatively if you want to complete this project in Javascript using React Native then that is also an option. This app should work with iOS 9+.

## Notes for compiling

This project uses Cocoapods (v1.3.1).
